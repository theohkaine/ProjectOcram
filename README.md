# ProjectOcram

Final project for a Monogame class at la Cit√©. 

A group project was tasked to create a brand new platforming game for the course. This project was coded in C#.

The main premise of the game is to reach the end of the game without dying once. You can shoot lasers or jump to bypass the obstacles.
